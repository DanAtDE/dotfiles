Key Value
=========
* Kyoto Cabinet -

Document
========

* CouchDB       - json documents.  Uses views (aggregate functions/filters) to query.
* Gimd          - git-based.  Possibly a good source for ideas.
* gitmodel      - Stores documents in /table/id/{data} format.  No searching/indexing/views - must know id.
* MongoDb       - Highly javascript-centric.  Seems to be very heavyweight.
* Solr/Lucene   -

Graph
=====

* FlockDB - Represents a directed graph but doesn't store any data other than id.

Distributed Stores
==================

* Cassandra - Something crazy.
* HBase     - Meh.
